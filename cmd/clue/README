To assemble a program:
	./clue -assemble="`cat program`"

The last line of the program might not get processed. Add some halts
to be sure.

To run a program:
	./clue < run-answer

To run a program and see only the bytes output by the processor
(and not the debugging stuff):
	./clue < run-answer > /dev/null

(The bytes output by the processor go to stderr.)

When you add the "-havingFun=false" flag, instruction logging
is turned on on both the remote and local processor, making it
much easier to see what's happening.
